Executive Summary

Update this section for this lab explaining the purpose of the lab
The purpose of this lab is to learn about windows, Apple, Vector, and Raster Graphics and etc.

Graphics

Raster vs. Vector Graphics

Explain the difference between a raster and vector image.
The difference between raster and vector image is that raster image looks like multiple tiny objects when you zoom into it. Vector image is made different because when it is zoomed in it stills look the same.

Include examples of when each would be most appropriate
Vector image can be used when you are designing a logo or t shirt. Raster image can be used when doing a computer assignment.

Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

Why does it matter to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats?
It matters to developers the formats they use because lossy formats is almost like a Raster Graphic and lossless format is like the Vector graphic because it does not have tiny pixel on the inside.

File Formats

Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files.
JPG file is an image format that uses lossy compression to create smaller files, GIF makes regular pictures become animated and PNG uses lossless data compression and it was created to replace the GIF image format. The similarities with all of them is that they use RGB colors and the difference with all of them is that they are functioned and operates in specific ways from each other.

Operating Systems
Upload screenshots for Operating System tasks to github

Logo

Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks 

Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required
The layers that were required with the logo I designed is 4 because I added a rectangle at the top, middle, bottom and the text that says "MIRACLE'S PIZZA SHOP".

Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)
The file size is 312KB (320,090 bytes). The file size on disk is 316KB (323,584 bytes). The application that will be more appropriate is window photo viewer. 

Conclusion
Summarize what you learned here

I learned a couple of things from this lab. I learned that vector and rasper looks different when it is zoomed in, I learned that Lossless and Lossy is almost similar to vector and rasper, I already know about the hardware and software because we did that on the last lab, I learned that windows and apple have special effects the other doesn't.
