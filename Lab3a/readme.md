Executive Summary
Software

Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each.

https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/cloud-vs-virtualization  

In your own words explain the difference between cloud computing and virtualization
Cloud computing is a service that delivers shared computing resources (software and/or data) on the internet but Virtualization allows you to deploy multiple operating system on a single machine.

Explain how a network administrator could move from virtualization to cloud computing? 
The way it can move is if you have intranet access, internet access, or both already established, virtualization can then be used to create clouds.
