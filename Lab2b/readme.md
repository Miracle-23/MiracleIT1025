Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

Hexadecimal color representation

Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/
The color description : Pure (or mostly pure) violet and The hexadecimal color #ab00ff has RGB values of R:171, G:0, B:255 and CMYK values of C:0.33, M:1, Y:0, K:0. Its decimal value is 11206911.

When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered.
The problem might be problematic depending on the person that is viewing it because it has shade color and tint color vibration.

Logic Gates and circuits

Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.
The output of a NAND gate is true when one or more, but not all, of its inputs are false. if all of a NAND gate's inputs are true, then the output of the NAND gate is false. 

How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate?
The NAND gate truth table and the AND gate truth table compare to each other because they both have Input A, Input B, and an output.

IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design
The purpose of IEEE is to develop and review all electronic in computer science.

Conclusion
Explain what you learnt from this lab

What I learned from this lab is that colorhexa shows information, tones, blindness simulator, decimals, percentages and etc for a specific color. The second thing I learned is that the IEEE is the largest technology operators in the world.
