Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab
The goal of this lab is to fully understand cybersecurity and how all our personal information can stay safe.

Cybersecurity and Encryption

Imagine you are part of the Amazon.com online chat. Explain how each component of the security triad would impact your job
it would impact my job because if I want to send a document or an information to another company or the people I am working with I have to send it in a specific way due to hackers.

Identify three daily tasks that require authentication. Explain how each one could be converted to multi-factor authentication
The tasks that require authentication is daily are Logging into email, Logging into school website and Using an ATM from the bank. The ways it can turn into multi-factor authentication: If you login into email sometimes you would have to verify it with a computer, if you are on the phone with a school counselor they can ask you personal information like date of birth, middle name and school ID number to make sure it's really you and if you are at the ATM you can verify your card is being used at the bank. 

Explain ACL and RBAC. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
ACL and RBAC is when you communicate in a secret way so no one can understand what you are saying. The advantage is that outsiders won't understand what we are talking about and the disadvantages is if one of the people forget how the secret alphabet works or if the hacker suprisingly break our riddle and then understands what is going on.

Explain the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key

Explain why we need public key cryptography.
Cryptography
Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message. Then explain the encryption here:

Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result. b) Would it be different for different languages?

What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?" Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word. Explain the result.

Brute Force
What is Brute-Force and how does it relate to Kerckhoffs's principle?
