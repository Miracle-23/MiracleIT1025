Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
Code of Ethics

Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.
The purpose of "code of ethics" is for the document details different actions that are considered appropriate and inappropriate. The ACM created a code for the computing discipline so everyone can see the straightforward ethical instructions.

Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.)
A code of ethics is a document that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group and a (AUP) acceptable use policy states out certain lines you can't cross or things outside the rules you cannot do.

Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP. Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.)
The site of my choice is nike. Link: https://agreementservice.svs.nike.com/us/en_us/rest/agreement?agreementType=termsOfUse&uxId=com.nike.commerce.nikedotcom.web&country=US&language=en&requestType=redirect The policy of my interest that surprises me is the eligibility, I did not know that one have to be an adult in order to use the site.

Intellectual Property

From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO. What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 
The purpose and importance of WIPO is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international IP system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all.

Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created.
copyright is obtained by making sure someone work is being used the proper way, the benefit of registering for a copyright is because a registered copyright is needed in order to bring legal action against someone who has used a work without permission. It is important to copyright the svg image you created because it protects your work from any outsiders using it without permission.

If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property.
The trademark would have to receive permission from you when they want to use your work; if they don't it would be a copyright.

Information Collection
Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet.
The COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) protects children and users under 13, FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) a law that parents have a right to their child’s educational information until the child reaches either the age of eighteen or begins attending school beyond the high school level and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) A law that gives patients specific rights to control their medical records.

URLs and File Paths
Match the following terms / definitions under the heading and explain how they are related by providing an example of all of the pieces of a URL: Terms: scheme, domain, top level domain, default page, parameters, anchor Definitions/examples: .edu, no file path provided, result of search, https, www.amazon.com, specific location on a page.
Scheme-Specific location on a page. (coming up with an idea to build the page). Domain-result of search. (address of a specific search) top level domain-amazon.com. (When you search for a site and it takes you there directly that is the biggest place you can be). default page-no file path provided. parameters-.edu. anchor-https 

What is your understanding of difference between Absolute and Relative File Paths. What would you use in your website? Why?
Absolute path have the root element and the complete directory list required to locate the file and Relative file path. I would use Absolute file path because all my work would not look the same.

Explain the purpose and use of file compression.
File compression is useful to reduce the size of a file whenever it gets too big so space will be available.

Conclusion
Include your conclusion here...
It is good to knw that we have copyright law so we cannot copy each other work and idea without the owner approval. If ideas are being constantly taken then things wouldn't be right.
