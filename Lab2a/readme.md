Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab
Hardware
Hard Drives and Memory

What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?
Latency rate is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head,after a completed seek. The transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to from the disk media and is a function of the recording frequency.

How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive? 
A solid state (SSD) uses a memory to store data to work and operate but the traditional hard drive has a disk in it and it sometimes take longer to operate.  

Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster? 
Increasing RAM make the computer run faster because the faster it collects the information and everything it needs the faster it'll go.

What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths? 
64 bit data is able to perform more task and connect more with the device. 32 bit data have limit to the task it can perform because it is much smaller than 64 bit data.

ALU and Control Unit

Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU
The control unit might be small but it is the main part of a computer, it sends and receive signals and commands.The ALU in CPU sends and receive signal as well but only digits and numbers.

CPU, Input and Output 
Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output
Input is when you send a command into the computer, For example: Clicking an object or typing a letter, Output is when the information is taken and put into another Physical Output. For example: when you type a letter or alphabet and it appears on the screen and CPU (Central Processing Unit) is when all the calculations are done. For example: When you hold "Ctrl" and the "S" button to save your work the computer quickly process the command you give it to do. 

Data Representation
Numeric Conversions

Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers
Decimal is the answer to the solving of the Binary numbers,Binary is a number that can be based from 2 and Hexadecimal numbers are whole numbers that is a 16 digit number that can also connet with alphabets

Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file)
Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work)
Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work)

Conclusion

Reflect on what you have learnt from this week
I learned how the CPU, Input, and Output functions and work. I know how to convert decimals to binary and convert binary to decimal; The only thing I will have a hard to solve is to convert decimal into hexademical.
