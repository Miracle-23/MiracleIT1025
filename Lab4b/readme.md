Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab
The goal for this lab is to understand how to use LucidChart, Networking, Network Hardware and Network Topology.

LucidChart
Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that asks for a number and then

prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
prints "Small" if the number is less than 10. Use the following resource (or one of your choice) as a guide: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_flowchart_elements.htm Add a textbox to the chart with your name

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)
Lucidchart is almost like programming but instead it justs keep all your work organized.
Lucidchart can be quiet confusing using it for the very first time but with practice you'll get used to it.
Lucidchart is a good way to keep your idea organized and it is good for basic step by step instructions.

Networking

Intro to Networking

Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions

Words:

Packet- Packet is the fundamental unit of data transmitted over the internet.  When a host (PC, workstation, server, printer, etc.) intends to send a message to another host (for example, your PC sends a request to YouTube to open a video), it breaks the message down into smaller pieces, called packets.

Packet-Switching- Packet switching is when  a messageâ€™s packets are sent on the Internet, routers try to find the optimal route for each packet. This can result in packets being sent on different routes to their destination.

IP Address-  Every device on the Internet (personal computer, a tablet, a smartphone, etc.) is assigned a unique identifying number called an IP (Internet Protocol) address.

DNS - DNS also known as domain name server or system.DNS acts as the directory of websites on the Internet. When a request to access a host with a domain name is given, a DNS server is queried. 

Protocol - Protocol is the set of rules that govern how communications take place on a network. For example, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are the communication rules for
transferring files from one host to another.

Definitions to match:

Set of rules to allow devices to communicate (Protocol)

Unit of data (Packet)

Unique identifying number (IP Address)

Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address (Packet-Switching)

Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com) (Domain name)

Network Hardware

Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub - Switch is a network device that connects multiple hosts together which means it can connect to multiple device. Hub connects multiple device as well but the difference is that they connect computers only.

Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches - Router does a lot more because it can receive and analyzes packet and then routes them towards their destination.

Network Topology

Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue - Single point of failure can happen to anyone and at anytime, it is simply wnen one of the conn

Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why? Infrastructure topology is better because I feel like it is more secured. Wireless Mesh can connect thousands of devices and I feel like it isn't safe.

Conclusion
Summarize how this lab was useful to you and what you learnt that really interested you! 
This lab was useful because it showed me what using Lucid would be like and I learnt that online places have an IP address because I never heard of that before, that made me surprise.
