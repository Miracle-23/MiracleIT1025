Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab
The goal for this lab is to understand how to use LucidChart, Networking, Network Hardware and Network Topology.

LucidChart
Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that asks for a number and then

prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
prints "Small" if the number is less than 10. Use the following resource (or one of your choice) as a guide: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_flowchart_elements.htm Add a textbox to the chart with your name

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)
Lucidchart is almost like programming but instead it justs keep all your work organized.
Lucidchart can be quiet confusing using it for the very first time but with practice you'll get used to it.
Lucidchart is a good way to keep your idea organized and it is good for basic step by step instructions.

Networking

Intro to Networking

Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions

Words:

Packet-Packet is the fundamental unit of data transmitted over the internet.  When a host (PC, workstation, server, printer, etc.) intends to send a message to another host (for example, your PC sends a request to YouTube to open a video), it breaks the message down into smaller pieces, called packets.

Packet-Switching
IP Address
DNS
Protocol
Definitions to match:

Set of rules to allow devices to communicate
Unit of data
Unique identifying number
Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)
Network Hardware
Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.
Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches.
Network Topology
Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.
Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?
Conclusion
Summarize how this lab was useful to you and what you learnt that really interested you!
